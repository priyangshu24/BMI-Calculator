What is BMI?
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value derived from your weight and height, used to assess whether an individual has a healthy body weight in relation to their height. It's a widely used measure for determining health risk categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese.

How It Works
The BMI Calculator uses the formula:

Metric Units: BMI = weight (kg) / [height (m)]²
Imperial Units: BMI = 703 × weight (lb) / [height (in)]²
Simply enter your height and weight in either unit, and the calculator will output your BMI value along with the health category it falls into.

Health Categories
Based on World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines:

Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
Obese: BMI ≥ 30
Why Use a BMI Calculator?
BMI is a general screening tool that helps identify potential health risks associated with body weight. While it doesn’t directly measure body fat, it provides a helpful starting point for understanding your general health.

Limitations
BMI doesn’t account for muscle mass, bone density, or body composition. It’s best used in conjunction with other health assessments.
